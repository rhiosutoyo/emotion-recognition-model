# Indonesian Twitter Emotion Recognition using Feature Engineering
This GitHub was created to provide supporting research materials of "Indonesian Twitter Emotion Recognition using Feature Engineering".

- **Dataset**<br>
The preprocessed dataset was derived from the [Indonesian Twitter Emotion Dataset](https://github.com/meisaputri21/Indonesian-Twitter-Emotion-Dataset) from [Saputri et al.](https://doi.org/10.1109/IALP.2018.8629262). In the data preprocessing, this work performs case-folding, removes irrelevant information, applies standardization, data stemming, and removes stop words. The file can be downloaded in this [CSV file](https://github.com/rhiosutoyo/emotion-recognition-model/blob/main/preprocessed-dataset.csv).

- **Full Experiment Result**<br>
The full results of the experiment can be seen in this [CSV file](https://github.com/rhiosutoyo/emotion-recognition-model/blob/main/full-experiment%20result.csv).
The order is sorted by f1 score (descending).
